# Web-game
Web programming course final project

Files project1, project2, project3 correspond to the main HTML,CSS and JS files, so you run project1 to run the game. 

The game is not screen size responsive, so I've added the "gamevideo" file with a video of it running on my PC. The FPS is low due to OBS recorder running.
